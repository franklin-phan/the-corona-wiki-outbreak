# **Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal**

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name:** Franklin Phan

**Project Name:** *Outbreak*

**Is your project New or Old?** New

**Is your project Solo or Team?** Team

## **Description**

**Write a paragraph summary of the current status of your project, what you hope to achieve during the intensive, how and why.**

With the recent Coronavirus outbreak, we’re witnessing mass hysteria about what to do and how to stay safe. To add to the confusion, there are multiple news sources that report on new tidbits of information on a local, statewide, national, and international level.

OUTBREAK serves to be a central hub of all info Coronavirus (and more diseases in the near future) where users can filter information by the region they live in, keep up with ongoing developments through sources like WHO and the CDC, have access to resources and debunk myths relating to the virus.

In the age of an exaggerated media landscape and overwhelming information consumption, the purpose of OUTBREAK is to give users/ordinary people a sense of security and a streamlined sense of understanding as they navigate through the unchartered waters of disease control.
